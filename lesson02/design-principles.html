            <p>Alignment is a fundamental principle of design that involves the strategic placement of visual elements
                so
                they line up in a cohesive manner. This approach not only creates balance and order but also helps
                viewers
                understand the relationships between different elements in a composition, enhancing overall organization
                and
                visual appeal. As you can see in the image, the shapes are aligned beatifully, and additionally, the
                icons
                and text in the middle, to create a visually appealing design.

            <p>The repetition principle of design means the repetition of the same or similar elements in a certain
                design.
                Repetition can be reflected in the use of the same or similar colors, shapes, lines, fonts, and other
                elements, and it differs from its other principles because it is not always meant to be noticed.The
                image
                portrays how various texts, colours, font have been repeated.
